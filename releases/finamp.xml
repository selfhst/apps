    <content>&lt;p&gt;This Finamp release adds more labels for screen readers within the app.&lt;br /&gt;
This has been back-ported from the beta version, which you should check out for an even better experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release also contains updated translations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chinese (Traditional Han script) - @boan51204, hugoalh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chinese (Traditional Han script, Hong Kong) - @SuperDumbTM &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finnish - @5kat3R&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;German - @Maxr1998, Retch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japanese - musenq, @motty-mio2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Korean - @jomunim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portuguese - @pedro-32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Russian - Yolkis, Ð•Ð³Ð¾Ñ€ Ð•Ñ€Ð¼Ð°ÐºÐ¾Ð², Dan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thai - @SpeedxPz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not already using it, you should be using the redesign beta! It fixes many technical issues in Finamp, especially around downloads, has much better queue management, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;

&lt;summary&gt;

## How to Join the Beta (click to expand)

&lt;/summary&gt;

The beta is free and open to everyone, but we'd like to get as much feedback as possible. So please do try it out and then let us know what you think!

1. Join the [Finamp Beta Testers Discord server](https://discord.gg/xh9SZ73jWk)
   - This step is optional, but since we're looking for feedback, it would be great if you could join!
   - Alternatively, there's a discussion for the beta right here on GitHub: [Redesign Beta discussion](https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp/discussions/603)
2. Take note of your current Finamp settings, since this is a beta it could happen that the update changes some of them.
   - Downloads should be migrated, but since the new download system is completely different, there might be inconsistencies.
3. On Android, join the beta on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unicornsonlsd.finamp) or download the APK file from below.  
   On iOS, join the beta on [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/UqHTQTSs).
   - We're currently not able to offer a beta on F-Droid ([more info here](https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp/issues/220#issuecomment-1850351616)), but you can use an app like [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) to automatically download the latest APK from GitHub.
4. Open Finamp and enjoy!

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep in mind that not all of the text in the beta has been translated yet, so it will be shown in English no matter which language your device is set to. We're not able to add more translations to the beta just yet (it's not as easy to configure as we'd hoped), but we'll let you know once you can help translating all of the new stuff!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;This release should fix issues with background playback, sorry about that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not already using it, you should be using the redesign beta! It fixes many technical issues in Finamp, especially around downloads, has much better queue management, and much more. It also managed to avoid this bug ðŸ™ƒ&lt;/p&gt;
