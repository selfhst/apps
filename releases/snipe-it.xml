&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This  version of Snipe-IT REQUIRES PHP 8.2.0 or greater.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Wednesday! This release fixes a few small bugs, updates a library dependency that had a CVE, and &lt;em&gt;hopefully&lt;/em&gt; handles some of our docker users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're sorry this has been a hassle for the docker folks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dockerhub makes it surprisingly un-intuitive to keep your Dockerhub namespace when you switch a GH repo namespace. Why would we want to keep our old Dockerhub namespace, you ask? Good question! Turns out you can't move namespaces and keep your stars and pull counts, which we kinda want, since we're the original creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to undo some of the much faster build optimizations we had previously made for Docker people - they take almost an &lt;em&gt;hour&lt;/em&gt; now - ouch. But we'll be revisiting that and speeding it back up in the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify, Docker folks should be pulling from &lt;code&gt;snipe/snipe-it&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;grokability/snipe-it&lt;/code&gt;. It's counter-intuitive, I know. Dockerhub won't let us move without losing literally a decade of pull and star stats. :( &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Livewire component for smoother check for location companies by @snipe in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16860&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set upload-limit by @chfsx in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16806&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adds Label fields offset as an option by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16790&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add barcode support for Avery 3490 by @realchrisolin in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16847&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed #15629 - prevent setting &lt;code&gt;assigned_to&lt;/code&gt; without setting assigned_type by @uberbrady in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/15907&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix dockerhub repo we're pushing to, and arm build names by @jerm in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16851&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added missing contributors by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16864&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed #16815: Avoids potential error when settings table is empty by @ntaylor-86 in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16865&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More dockerhub repo references by @jerm in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16868&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One more docker repo name fix by @jerm in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16871&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redirect options on audit by @snipe in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16873&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed breadcrumbs for cloning by @snipe in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16874&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixes CVE-2025-46734: league/commonmark contains a XSS vulnerability in Attributes extension  by @joelpittet in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16875&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move back to multiarch builds with emulation (for now) by @jerm in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16876&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Contributors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@chfsx made their first contribution in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16806&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;@realchrisolin made their first contribution in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16847&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v8.1.15</title>
    <updated>2025-06-02T13:38:24-04:00</updated>

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This  version of Snipe-IT REQUIRES PHP 8.2.0 or greater.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday everyone! This release offers some UX fixes, some API enhancements for consistency, and three new classes of things you can use the importer for: manufacturers, suppliers, and categories.  See what's on deck for the next release here: https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/milestone/26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Important API header change:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to to make it easier for you folks to build all the great stuff you do with the Snipe-IT REST API, we've added a few additional headers on API requests. Now every API request will return the following headers &lt;em&gt;regardless&lt;/em&gt; of whether you've hit your API limit and are now returning a &lt;code&gt;429&lt;/code&gt; response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| Header  | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| &lt;code&gt;X-RateLimit-Limit&lt;/code&gt;  | The rate limit defined in your &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;API_THROTTLE_PER_MINUTE&lt;/code&gt;|
| &lt;code&gt;X-RateLimit-Reset&lt;/code&gt; | The reset in seconds  |
| &lt;code&gt;X-RateLimit-Remaining&lt;/code&gt; | The remaining requests within the &lt;code&gt;X-RateLimit-Reset&lt;/code&gt; |
| &lt;code&gt;X-RateLimit-Reset-Timestamp&lt;/code&gt; | The epoch timestamp for when the rate limit will reset |
| &lt;code&gt;Retry-After&lt;/code&gt; | The reset in seconds, same as &lt;code&gt;X-RateLimit-Reset&lt;/code&gt;  |&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous versions of the API would only return some of these headers if you were getting a &lt;code&gt;429 - too many requests&lt;/code&gt; response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width="479" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-02 at 6 30 02 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2369ac09-c3c8-4eb8-abd4-47fad41ec6d2" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This  version of Snipe-IT REQUIRES PHP 8.2.0 or greater.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday, everyone!  This release fixes some bugs around maintenances and bulk editing custom fields, adds the ability create multiple maintenances at one time, and took some steps to speed some things up in some interfaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned &lt;a href="https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/discussions/17066"&gt;here on Github&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://grokstar.dev/news/snipeit-releases/2025/06/messing-around-and-finding-out/"&gt;on our blog&lt;/a&gt;, we're experimenting with a new way of handling issues, requests, etc here. We're trying to break as much as we can down into two-week sprints - you can &lt;a href="https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/milestone/26"&gt;see the past sprint we just closed here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also continue experimenting with the Roadmap view on Github in an ongoing effort to convey what we're currently working on, what longer-term features we're trying to find solutions for, and so on. (The roadmap view is a little cumbersome to manage on our end, but we'll keep trying.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't quite make all of the items in first sprint so they've been moved to the  next one, but we'll get a better sense for that over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed #17076: Disable optional status ID form field if value is blank/Do Not Change by @snipe in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/17078&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed #17085: &lt;code&gt;assigned_type&lt;/code&gt; not being nulled on asset delete+checkin by @snipe in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/17087&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bumped container image versions by @kovacs-andras in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/16998&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v8.1.17</title>

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This  version of Snipe-IT REQUIRES PHP 8.2.0 or greater.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday, nerds! This release closes &lt;a href="https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/milestone/27"&gt;Sprint Weeks 25-26&lt;/a&gt;.  We've a few folks out on vacation last week and this week, so our velocity might be slightly impacted, but we'll be going through &lt;a href="https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/milestone/28"&gt;the next sprint&lt;/a&gt; today to make sure it's reasonable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been trying to stick to the defined Sprints, and also to start releasing consistently every other Monday. Obviously, that's going to be a best effort, and delays could be caused by high-impact bugs or regressions, so don't be too weirded out if you also see an out-of-band release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the upcoming months, we're going to be tackling some larger issues that will enable us to move faster: a big refactor to how the logging system works, reworking some of the permissions and notifications, upgrading the UI to use a more modern version of Bootstrap so that we have an easier time integrating some of the features folks have been asking for, etc. This might mean you see a slow-down in feature requests being addressed, but it will set us up for success down the line. These are the unglamorous bits that need to be done behind the scenes to be able to move forward faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few highlights of this release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Manager user view setting was introduced that allows managers to see the items checked out to their direct reports. This is optionally enabled under &lt;code&gt;Admin Settings &amp;gt; General&lt;/code&gt;. We may rework this a little more to make that granular on individual users instead of a global setting, but we're waiting to hear feedback from our users to see if that's needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've standardized the common table features (such as print, advanced search, fullscreen, etc) so that all of the table views should now have mostly the same features to improve consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fixed an issue where the SAML XML file would not correctly upload (the workaround was to copy+paste it into the textarea field, but you shouldn't have to do that anymore.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fixed the permissions on EULAs so that users can now correctly download their own EULAs in their profile area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We added the ability to send an acceptance/declined email notification to the admin who checked the item out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
