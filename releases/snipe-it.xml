&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The NEXT major release of Snipe-IT (v7.0.0) will require PHP 8.1 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday, friends! This is the final release of the v6 line of Snipe-IT. (I know, I know.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're hosted with us, you'll have these changes in your hot little hands within a day or so. If you're not, please make sure to upgrade your version of Snipe-IT. But more importantly, please make sure you're running PHP 8.1.x+ before you try to upgrade again after this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No breaking changes, just some small tweaks, a few added features, and a few bug fixes. We did have to address a potential (though very hard to exploit) permissions escalation issue, which is why we're making this 6.4.0 instead of a point release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;v7 has been a long time coming, but we're nearly there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks as always to our community contributors for their awesome work! &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The NEXT major release of Snipe-IT (v7.0.0) will require PHP 8.1 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi folks - happy Monday! This is just tiny release to handle a few small remaining bug fixes as we head into v7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/tree/snipeit_v7_laravel10"&gt;current working v7 branch&lt;/a&gt; will be merged into the existing develop branch within the week, and will then be available on the https://develop.snipeitapp.com demo link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This update fixes a small issue with notifications and also optimizes some of the queries that populate the sidebar that could have slowed things down for folks with a lot of assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load settings in &lt;code&gt;SendUpcomingAuditReport&lt;/code&gt; command by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14690&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixes #14692 - set default variables for sidebar totals by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14693&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixes #14701 - wrong total asset count by @Toreg87 in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14702&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed UI where delete button was not disabled even if the user couldn't be deleted by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14697&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix memory-hog query in AssetCountForSidebar middleware by @jerm in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14711&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bump codacy/codacy-analysis-cli-action from 4.4.0 to 4.4.1 by @dependabot in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14715&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;The NEXT MAJOR release of Snipe-IT (v7.0.0) will require PHP 8.1 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we wrap it all up for v7 (which you can preview on the &lt;code&gt;snipeit_v7_laravel10&lt;/code&gt; branch, we knew there would be a few more things we needed to handle. Most of these are small bugfixes (that have already been merged into the v7 branch) but we also came across some security issues that we wanted to patch as we close off the v6 line. Users are encouraged to upgrade to v6.4.2 - and of course, encouraged to make sure your servers are ready for v7 with PHP8.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: </title>

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Snipe-IT now requires PHP 8.1 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's always one, isn't there :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fixes a framework compatibility issue we missed that no longer uses the static &lt;code&gt;Request::has()&lt;/code&gt; facade, and adds some tests to make sure we don't miss that in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
