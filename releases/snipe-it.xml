    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v7.0.10</title>

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Snipe-IT now requires PHP 8.1.2 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is just a point release, we're really excited for this one. We've a bunch of small bug fixes, but also added some UX sugar that we think will make everyone's workflows a little bit easier. You can now decide where you want to go after creating, editing, or checking in/out a first class object (Assets, Accessories, Licenses, Users, etc). You can also now check out more than one accessory at a time, if that's a thing that comes up in your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also: If your table listings text ("Showing x of y pages") defaulted to Chinese, this release handles that (via https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15133).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been doing a ton of under the hood stuff that won't seem very obvious as users, but it puts us in a much better position to move more quickly on a lot of things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important technical note: this release mitigates a difficult to exploit but possible attack. If someone had access to your &lt;code&gt;APP_KEY&lt;/code&gt;, it was possible to perform an RCE attack. We mitigated this by disabling cookie serialization, but I'd still argue that if someone has your &lt;code&gt;APP_KEY&lt;/code&gt;, you're going to have a bad time in a bunch of other ways, so this is just a gentle reminder than your APP_KEY should never, ever be shared with anyone, for any reason, and you should never use the default &lt;code&gt;APP_KEY&lt;/code&gt; values we have in some of our example env files. If you have encrypted custom fields and need to roll your &lt;code&gt;APP_KEY&lt;/code&gt; because you feel it could have been compromised, &lt;a href="https://snipe-it.readme.io/docs/key-rotation"&gt;we have a cli utility to handle that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up: Custom fields for users, and the ability to check out accessories to assets and locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v7.0.11</title>

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Snipe-IT now requires PHP 8.1.2 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Thursday everyone! This release comes with a bunch of small UX/UI improvements, and a few additional features, including the ability to optionally update the asset's status on quick scan checkin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also added the ability to play sounds on the "quick" bulk tasks like auditing for better accessibility. (You will have to enable this in your profile.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also added a command-line utility that can help some folks who may have used the API to checkout assets without specifying an &lt;code&gt;assigned_type&lt;/code&gt;, and could get a 500 error when trying to view those assets. (We have since improved the API validation to require the &lt;code&gt;assigned_type&lt;/code&gt;, but older assets created via API could have had this issue.) &lt;a href="https://snipe-it.readme.io/docs/fix-missing-assigned-type"&gt;See the docs on that utility here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up next, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15185"&gt;ability to checkout accessories to assets and locations&lt;/a&gt;. The functionality has been built, but there are some safeguards we still have to put in to make sure you cannot delete locations or assets that still have accessories associated with them. We &lt;a href="https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15235"&gt;have a PR up for that&lt;/a&gt; and are working on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v7.0.13</title>
    <updated>2024-10-02T07:56:02-04:00</updated>

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Snipe-IT now requires PHP 8.1.2 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="liz-lemon-wednesday" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59e484d8-8245-4827-adc0-e5fd24949fd5" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Wednesday, everyone! We're pleased to announce Snipe-IT v7.13 is out. The most notable fix in this release is for folks who suddenly couldn't create asset models with the same name but different model number. That was a temporary issue in validation and should be fixed now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also added the long-requested ability to sort numerically on numeric custom fields. (Folks who are not using MySQL/MariaDB, please let us know if this breaks stuff for you, even though we don't officially support non-MySQL databases.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also added a new bulk option for users, which is the ability to print all items associated with multiple selected users, if that's the sort of thing you're likely to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, on most list views, you can now see (and sort by) which administrator created the item. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!WARNING]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;API Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've added a &lt;code&gt;created_by&lt;/code&gt; field to additional endpoints. This field replaces the previous &lt;code&gt;user_id&lt;/code&gt; API object,  which was only being returned in a few places. The &lt;code&gt;user_id&lt;/code&gt; object will still be returned as normal, but you should plan on making that switch in your API integrations moving forward, as it will eventually be removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed a couple bugs in &lt;code&gt;CustomFieldSetDefaultValuesForModel&lt;/code&gt; component by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/15486&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v7.1.14 - Security Release</title>
    <updated>2024-11-13T19:19:43-05:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]
 &lt;strong&gt;This is a security release. All Snipe-IT users are strongly encouraged to upgrade.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!WARNING]
 &lt;strong&gt;FYI, in our excitement to get this released, we mistakenly tagged this as 7.1.14 instead of 7.0.14 (yay, automation, amirite?) Unfortunately, deleting tags makes this more difficult for our docker users, so we're just running with it.&lt;/strong&gt; Sorry for the confusion, but you didn't miss anything, it was just a simple typo. We'll update the version.php file so at least they both agree. There are no new server requirements or libraries required outside of the standard 7.x.x requirements to handle this upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="liz-lemon-wednesday" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59e484d8-8245-4827-adc0-e5fd24949fd5" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We seem to be getting a lot of mileage from that gif these days. 🫠&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a security release that handles several CVEs, including &lt;a href="https://www.securityhive.io/blog/understanding-cve-2024-52301-why-you-must-upgrade-your-laravel-application"&gt;CVE-2024-52301&lt;/a&gt;, which was just patched in the Laravel core yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While hosted customers were NOT affected (we do not have &lt;code&gt;register_argc_argv&lt;/code&gt; enabled on any of our servers), self-hosted community users and support-only customers are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible, or at the very least &lt;a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php"&gt;make sure that setting is not enabled&lt;/a&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;php.ini&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the security patches, we have also added some new features, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to import Asset Models (without accompanying assets) via the Importer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to override or null out the EOL date for assets via the asset bulk edit screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimized some queries and indexes to speed things up a bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed a bug where OU was accidentally required to create locations via the GUI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Miscellaneous UI improvements and fixes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full changelog can be found below&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, still lots more on deck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS - we will likely be discontinuing posting updates on our Twitter account moving forward. Instead, find us in these other places:&lt;/p&gt;
