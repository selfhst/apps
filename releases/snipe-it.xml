&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This  version of Snipe-IT REQUIRES PHP 8.2.0 or greater.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday, everyone!  This release fixes some bugs around maintenances and bulk editing custom fields, adds the ability create multiple maintenances at one time, and took some steps to speed some things up in some interfaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned &lt;a href="https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/discussions/17066"&gt;here on Github&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://grokstar.dev/news/snipeit-releases/2025/06/messing-around-and-finding-out/"&gt;on our blog&lt;/a&gt;, we're experimenting with a new way of handling issues, requests, etc here. We're trying to break as much as we can down into two-week sprints - you can &lt;a href="https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/milestone/26"&gt;see the past sprint we just closed here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also continue experimenting with the Roadmap view on Github in an ongoing effort to convey what we're currently working on, what longer-term features we're trying to find solutions for, and so on. (The roadmap view is a little cumbersome to manage on our end, but we'll keep trying.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't quite make all of the items in first sprint so they've been moved to the  next one, but we'll get a better sense for that over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>New release for Snipe-IT: v8.1.17</title>
    <updated>2025-06-30T07:26:27-04:00</updated>

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This  version of Snipe-IT REQUIRES PHP 8.2.0 or greater.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday, nerds! This release closes &lt;a href="https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/milestone/27"&gt;Sprint Weeks 25-26&lt;/a&gt;.  We've a few folks out on vacation last week and this week, so our velocity might be slightly impacted, but we'll be going through &lt;a href="https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/milestone/28"&gt;the next sprint&lt;/a&gt; today to make sure it's reasonable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been trying to stick to the defined Sprints, and also to start releasing consistently every other Monday. Obviously, that's going to be a best effort, and delays could be caused by high-impact bugs or regressions, so don't be too weirded out if you also see an out-of-band release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the upcoming months, we're going to be tackling some larger issues that will enable us to move faster: a big refactor to how the logging system works, reworking some of the permissions and notifications, upgrading the UI to use a more modern version of Bootstrap so that we have an easier time integrating some of the features folks have been asking for, etc. This might mean you see a slow-down in feature requests being addressed, but it will set us up for success down the line. These are the unglamorous bits that need to be done behind the scenes to be able to move forward faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few highlights of this release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Manager user view setting was introduced that allows managers to see the items checked out to their direct reports. This is optionally enabled under &lt;code&gt;Admin Settings &amp;gt; General&lt;/code&gt;. We may rework this a little more to make that granular on individual users instead of a global setting, but we're waiting to hear feedback from our users to see if that's needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've standardized the common table features (such as print, advanced search, fullscreen, etc) so that all of the table views should now have mostly the same features to improve consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fixed an issue where the SAML XML file would not correctly upload (the workaround was to copy+paste it into the textarea field, but you shouldn't have to do that anymore.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fixed the permissions on EULAs so that users can now correctly download their own EULAs in their profile area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We added the ability to send an acceptance/declined email notification to the admin who checked the item out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added Manager View to enable managers to see the items checked out to their direct reports by @lukaskraic in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/17096&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Fixed #17215: Check for acceptance logo vs regular logo in print views by @snipe in https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/17216&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This is a security release. All Snipe-IT users are encouraged to upgrade.&lt;/strong&gt; This  version of Snipe-IT REQUIRES PHP 8.2.0 or greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Wednesday, everyone! This is a security release due to &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54068"&gt;CVE-2025-54068&lt;/a&gt; in Livewire announced last week. We were patched on the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch hours after the CVE announcement came out, but this is the official tagged release for the patch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, we have some fixes for custom fields, lots of new tests to better support the team as we continue to work towards &lt;a href="https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/issues/17370"&gt;improving notifications&lt;/a&gt; to make them more flexible and nuanced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Potentially Breaking Changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;User Permissions Change&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was already true that only superusers could assign new permission groups and promote other users to superadmin, but we've tighten a few more of these controls to disallow editing email address, username, password, and ability to login by users with lower privileges then the user they're trying to edit - meaning admins cannot edit superadmin usernames, email, etc - and regular users who have user editing permission cannot modify those settings for either admins or superadmins, though they can still edit those properties for other regular users. See https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/pull/17423 for more info there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;User Welcome Emails&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've removed the ability to include credentials for newly created users via import or through the GUI, instead replacing it with the ability to send them a password reset "invitation". Sending passwords via email has been considered a bad idea for a while, so this method seems better. Note that if the newly created user doesn't have an email address in the import, we obviously cannot send them a password reset email, so those emails won't go out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
