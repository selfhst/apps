    <content>&lt;h2&gt;⚠️ IMPORTANT: Future versions of Snipe-IT will require PHP 8.1 or greater&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year, everyone! This update is a big one as we ramp up for the release of v7. We've got tons of bug-fixes, big and small, and we're stoked to announce &lt;strong&gt;support for Microsoft Teams&lt;/strong&gt; in the notification integrations. As we continue work on v7, expect even more improvements and flexibility in notifications down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also added the ability to specify custom fields that you would like to appear on the requestable assets page, and added user edit logging to track changes to users in the system (minus passwords, 2fa tokens, etc, of course), along with some bulk editing, LDAP and SAML improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full list of changes is below - enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[!WARNING]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Future versions of Snipe-IT will require PHP 8.1 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a small patch release that fixes a few regressions introduced in the last released related to labels. It also includes some minor security patches, and introduces a new script to &lt;a href="https://snipe-it.readme.io/docs/convert-unencrypted-custom-fields"&gt;convert a previously unencrypted custom field to be an encrypted custom field&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;v7 is still well on its way. We hit a small snag with Laravel's switch from Swiftmailer to Symfony for mail sending, but we're back on track now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Default label setup with custom fields by @Godmartinz in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14320&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Guard against checking require acceptance on non-existent relationship in accessory model by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14393&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[Snyk] Upgrade webpack from 5.90.1 to 5.90.2 by @snipe in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14395&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure Chat and Teams endpoints are not blank before attempting to send webhook on checkout and check in by @marcusmoore in https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/pull/14394&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[!CAUTION]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The upcoming v7 release of Snipe-IT will require PHP 8.1 or greater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Friday! Lots of fixes and improvements in this version. Here's the tldr;, with the full changelog below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added Somali translation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed several label setting glitches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed some API scoping issues where results were not as constrained as they should have been when searching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added column selectors and signatures to the "print all assigned" page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 2FA reset logging (this shows up as a separate action, not a normal user edit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added AVIF as an accepted image format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added ability to "toggle all" columns in the list views on most pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added the ability to "deep link" to search results in those list views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated the documentation to reflect that the &lt;a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/exif.setup.php"&gt;php exif&lt;/a&gt; library is required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!WARNING]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Upcoming Breaking API change!&lt;/strong&gt; In between the last release and this one, we also discovered that a change we made midway through releases broke the &lt;a href="https://github.com/grokability/jamf2snipe"&gt;Jamf2Snipe&lt;/a&gt; integration for adding/updating assets. We had changed the "shape" of the asset response to be more consistent with how we present that JSON in other API responses - however in doing so, we broke some of the Jamf2Snipe capabilities. We've reverted that change for now, but in the next release, we'll be adding that change back &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; updating the Jamf2Snipe library to match that capability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; noticing in some of the translations in CrowdIn that some &lt;code&gt;trans_choice()&lt;/code&gt; translations are showing with a weird &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;unk&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; symbol instead of the pipe (&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;) symbol that the translations strings need in order to decide whether or not to pluralize a string. We've been fixing them as we find them, but if you see anything unusual, open an issue here or &lt;a href="https://crowdin.com/project/snipe-it"&gt;propose the change in our CrowdIn project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
