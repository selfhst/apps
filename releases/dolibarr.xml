&lt;h2&gt;WARNING:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following changes may create regressions for some external modules, but were necessary to make Dolibarr better:
* Prepare your module for deprecation of triggers code XXX_INSERT to support also XXX_CREATE.
* More class properties (with old name in french) are now deprecated in favor of the property name in english.
* The json emulator dol_json_encode/decode() is removed. The native json PHP module must be enabled/available (this is the case by default with most PHP installation).
* The deprecated GET parameter "&amp;amp;sall=" has been removed, use now the "&amp;amp;search_all=".
* The experimental and deprecated module WebserviceClient is completely removed (was never released and use deprecated architecture). It may be replaced with the stable module Webhook.
* The dynamic properties -&amp;gt;no_button_delete, -&amp;gt;no_button_edit, -&amp;gt;no_button_copy for $object Product that could be set by an external module must no more be
  set (not allowed by PHP 8.2). A module can already return an array with key 'no_button_delete', 'no_button_edit', 'no_button_copy' for the same purpose.
* The old function dol_bc($var, $moreclass = '') has been removed. If you called it, just stop to call it (the function has no effect since a long time).
* The trigger code CATEGORY_LINK and CATEGORY_UNLINK have been replaced with code CATEGORY_MODIFY. You can read -&amp;gt;context['linkto'] or -&amp;gt;context['unlinkoff'] to detect if we want to make a link or unlink.
* The property -&amp;gt;domiciliation and -&amp;gt;propio on bank accounts has been deprecated and replaced with property -&amp;gt;address and -&amp;gt;owner_name everywhere.
* If you were using the substitution key &lt;strong&gt;MEMBER_CIVILITY&lt;/strong&gt;, you must now use &lt;strong&gt;MEMBER_TITLE&lt;/strong&gt;
* The hidden title of tab that was hidden by the CSS class tabTitleText has been completely removed from HTML content.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
