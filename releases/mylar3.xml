    <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improvements&lt;/strong&gt;
IMP: Prefer HD-Upscale/HD-Digital added as an option under the DDL banner in the config page.
IMP: Permissions redid to make sure that owner / group values entered are present prior to attempting to enforce. If not available will default to the user running mylar or the group user belong to depending on what is not present.
IMP: Manage DDL page -&amp;gt; will now show the full filename of the pack instead of series #issuenumber (ie. Superhero # 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixes&lt;/strong&gt;
FIX: (#1461) MAC OS metadata files would be scanned in mistakingly during series page loads / rechecks
FIX: (#1444) Annuals not included during group metatagging operation
FIX: (#1446) Occasional db conflict during issue updates in previous PR
FIX: Fixed some table overlapping on the Manage DDL page resulting in overflows
FIX: Increased last issue table on main page as was cutting off/overlapping on large issue numbers
FIX: When updating series info with new issue data, if a series was paused it would un-pause and mark issues as wanted if the options were enabled (mark all as wanted, mark upcoming as wanted)
FIX: Provider order would not be honored if DDL was an available option due to the way the search thru number padding was. Will now search all possible queries in a provider before moving onto the next provider regardless of the issue number
FIX: Searching would take the cover date as the actual search date, not the store date which caused problems around the end of the year
FIX: New issues set to Skipped even when series is not paused
FIX: CDH would fail to post-process items immediately if additional items were in the sabnzbd queue
FIX: When searching for issues published in late 2023, wouldn't match to 2024 filenames due to invalid date comparison
FIX: Mark all issues as wanted config option would mark every issue of a series as Wanted after each recheck/refresh that was not in a Downloaded status, regardless of previous state (ie. manually marking an issue as Skipped)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

IMP: (DDL -- config.ini) ddl_priority_order can be customized to set the priority order in which the DDL links will be attempted
IMP: (DDL) Will cycle thru ddl_priority_order in sequence attempting each link as it gets to it, until link is able to be downloaded or link exhaustion occurs

IMP: (DDL) Improved Pack parsing / detection
IMP: Dupechecker will now prioritize (F#)/(f#) in filenames as 'Fixed' over normally named files or lower numbered (f#)
IMP: Pack issue # tracking will track issues that belong to a particular pack so individually queueing issues within pack before it's completed, will not redownload issues belonging to the pack.
IMP: Added Link column to DDL Manage page (display which type of link was/is being used)
IMP: (DDL --&amp;gt; Manage) Adjusted column widths &amp;amp; spacing to correct some double-lines occurring

IMP: CT will now use user_agent string defined by Mylar as opposed to a random generic one on each request (if not updated, will force-update it accordingly)
IMP: Removed individual provider entries for nzbsu and dognzb from GUI, now treated as newznabs. If enabled, will be converted to newznab entry provided doesn't already exist as a newznab.
IMP: If CV indicates series year does not exist (ie. 2099) instead of using 2099, will use year of first issue or if not invalid, current year
IMP: When refreshing/adding a series that has a directory created with the incorrect year (2099), rename existing directory using correct year
IMP: Allow for future removal of outdated config.ini options with BAD_DEFINITIONS code
IMP: CV Api Key entry field on configuration page proper placeholder of None so will auto-remove value prior to typing in field
IMP: Add option to remove SABnzbd completed downloads from SABnzbd history
IMP: ASCII art logo added to startup sequence (cause why not, right?)
IMP: Test python module requirements prior to actually starting the program - failure will result in application exit with appropriate log messages

IMP: scheduled searches will have status checked prior to actually searching (cannot be in a Downloaded or Snatched status) unless it was initiated manually (ie. magnifying glass search)
IMP: Added Remove option to DDL table options so items that are stuck in a Start/Incomplete status can be removed
IMP: Detect and handle CV reusing existing ComicIDs via GUI Dialog (Keep / Delete) (see #1506)
IMP: Status color-coded legend to the bottom of the main watchlist/index page
