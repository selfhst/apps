  - unique notepad naming appending &lt;code&gt;-1, -2, -3&lt;/code&gt; respectively to notepad names
  - fixes: https://github.com/DumbWareio/DumbPad/issues/18, https://github.com/DumbWareio/DumbPad/issues/8

  - auto expands expandable details section for print previews
- New setting to disable auto expand details sections for print previews &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!NOTE]
New service worker changes should auto bust and reload your cache for you but it that doesn't work
Make sure to clear your browser cache and reload to reflect the new changes
Dev console &amp;gt; Application &amp;gt; Storage &amp;gt; Clear site data
After the new cache has been applied, new versions will auto bust and reload your cache for you moving forward&lt;/p&gt;
