    <content>&lt;h2&gt;Versioned docker tags added! ðŸš€&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;https://hub.docker.com/r/dumbwareio/dumbpad/tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment you can use &lt;code&gt;dumbwareio/dumbpad:1.0.0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;dumbwareio/dumbpad:latest&lt;/code&gt; as the docker image
- moving forward any new changes will become a version release and you can always update/rollback to other versions as needed&lt;/p&gt;
