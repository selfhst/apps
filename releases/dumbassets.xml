&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you behind on managing all of your favorite assets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have too much &lt;em&gt;junk in your trunk&lt;/em&gt; and need a way to organize all the paperwork and information that goes along with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, DumbAssets is here to stop you from feeling like a &lt;em&gt;bum&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| &lt;strong&gt;Hierarchical Asset Management&lt;/strong&gt; | Place components under parents, and children under children. |
| &lt;strong&gt;Warranty Expiration Notifications&lt;/strong&gt; | Get alerts via Apprise for upcoming warranty expirations. |
| &lt;strong&gt;Scheduled Maintenance Notifications&lt;/strong&gt; | DumbAssets remembers to remind you about routine tasks like changing air filters or adding salt to your water softener. |
| &lt;strong&gt;Asset Add/Edit/Delete Notifications&lt;/strong&gt; | Receive customizable notifications whenever an asset is modified. |
| &lt;strong&gt;Photo/Receipt/Manual Storage&lt;/strong&gt; | Store photos of items, receipts, and manuals digitally for easy access. |
| &lt;strong&gt;Tags&lt;/strong&gt; | Organize assets with customizable tags. |
| &lt;strong&gt;Sorting/Filtering&lt;/strong&gt; | Sort and filter assets by warranty expirations/status, components, tags, search input, and alphabetical/expiration date. |&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of DumbAss...ets is to allow you the ability to manage all of your assets and related tasks in one app. Organizing each asset into it's proper place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hierarchical Management:
The thing I'm most excited about is our ability to add components and sub-components to items, allowing you to organize things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server Rack
  - Dell R730
    - Toshiba 4TB HDD 
    - XEON 2580
  - Zyxel GS1900
  - Ubiquiti Router&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With product/warranty/maintenance info specified for each item!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DumbAssets is available on &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/dumbwareio/dumbassets"&gt;Dockerhub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give the &lt;a href="https://github.com/DumbWareio/DumbAssets"&gt;DumbAssets&lt;/a&gt; github repository a star and follow &lt;a href="https://github.com/DumbWareio"&gt;DumbWareio&lt;/a&gt; on Github for more updates and apps like this! We also appreciate coffee ðŸ˜€&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;a href="http://dumbware.io/"&gt;DumbWare.io&lt;/a&gt; family, we're continuing our mission of developing stupid simple apps "that just work". Join our &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/zJutzxWyq2"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; community to share your dumb problems and pitch amazing dumb ideas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay dumb, friends!&lt;/p&gt;
