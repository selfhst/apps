    <title>New release for Kavita: v0.8.5.11 - Hotfix 2</title>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;I decided to do one more hotfix as there was an annoying bug for multi-root libraries that causes flip-flopping (the same issue as covers disappearing). This also contains some fixes around scrobbling and misc other bugs reported that are a good fit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;v0.8.6 is still planned to focus on the Scanner and finishing off the Kavita+ Polish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Changed&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Locale selection now shows the total percentage of completion of the locale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Cleaned up some code around localization as a way to hopefully fight the keys showing in the UI on new versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: (Kavita+) When a user removes the Kavita+ license from their instance, stop doing all K+ Background tasks instead of waiting for the next restart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: (Kavita+) Kavita will now clean up old scrobble events for users that don't have an anilist token on their account, so that events that will never get processed get cleaned up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: (Kavita+) When sourcing descriptions from Kavita+, remove the (Source: X).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Fixed&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed a bug where a signature on an API was wrong &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: (Kavita+) Fixed a length issue for reviews from Kavita+ that could break metadata matching &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: (Kavita+) Fixed some edge case handling of want to read scrobbling and potentially some issues around events that never get processed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed unable to start Kavita for the first time on DD/MM/YYYY locales (Thanks @Fesaa )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed a bug where multi-root libraries would delete and recreate series in one of non-first folders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed reading list not respecting age restrictions (Thanks @Fesaa )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;API&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updated the ReadHistoryEvent to expose ReadDateUtc instead of just the server timezone date. (Thanks @0xGingi)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Known Issues&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker images aren't showing Locale names correctly (this will be fixed v0.8.6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

    <title>New release for Kavita: v0.8.6 - Spring Cleaning</title>
    <updated>2025-04-14T18:09:30-04:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>Kareadita/Kavita</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;p&gt;v0.8.6 is here and it's only fair to call this the Spring-Cleaning release as over the past 3 weeks, Amelia (@Fesaa) and I have closed out 65 issues from Github and polished a ton of the app. This release is packed with a lot of OLD issues finally being tackled and a few of them are quite annoying, so let's get started with the breakdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let's talk about the few enhancements that made it into the release. One of these enhancements was around Smart Filters and removing them from your customize list or renaming them. Both are features that weren't thought about in the initial implementation and just kept slipping through the cracks. Amelia took it upon herself to not only implement but also add some drag and drop reordering on the side nav for those that don't want to go into customize screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another nice enhancement is around Media Errors. I implemented Media Errors after being inspired by Komga feature, but never gave it much more thought after that. You know what's annoying? Having 300 media errors that aren't actually reflective of the state of your media. The original thought was manually clearing the alerts, but why can't Kavita just do most of those checks for you? So that's what this feature brings. Kavita will check if files were successfully imported with at least 1 page or 1 word and clear out the issue for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last big enhancement is around Reading Lists. I'm not a huge reading list user, but the folks over in CBL project have been discussing some polish that is needed and raised a great &lt;a href="https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/discussions/3671"&gt;Feature Request&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these were no-brainers, so I took a few days and implemented some much-needed polish and exposed more metadata around the reading list. My favorite is not being in edit mode by default. If you have ideas on how to make the Reading List experience better, please add your ideas to the Feature Request. I have already confirmed I will be doing a big overhaul once I have a good picture of the features user's want and need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the enhancements out of the way, let's focus on the meat of this release, the bugfixes and polish. I'll open with one I know many readers are going to enjoy--the webtoon reader finally tracks the last page read when using the continuous reader 100% of the time. The nightly users and I tested this by reading a combined 700 chapters (500 of those were just @duplaja, go figures). Shoutout to @reinar for providing some code that helped me get the needed fix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major fix, with the help yet again of Amelia, is the localization fix. Non-English locales have been having issues with Kavita for the last few releases and due to me not being able to reproduce the issues, I used a shotgun approach to fixing the issue. Luckily Amelia has such a setup and was able to fix it. Docker users can now remove the &lt;code&gt;DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT=true&lt;/code&gt; from their compose file and Kavita should work across the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Docker users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remove &lt;code&gt;DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT=true&lt;/code&gt; from your compose files. It is no longer needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Amelia polished a lot of the UI for the epub reader, closing out some annoying issues around scrolling, especially on iOS (which I cannot test against) and I focused on the backend, allowing for loosened parsing requirements, but still reporting the issue to Media Errors (Thanks to @vers-one for enhancing their library). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This overall feels like a great release with a lot of polish and stability. Many other issues were fixed, and I feel very confident in this release. The next release is planned to focus on the Scanner and see if some more instability can be ironed out and apply some more performance improvements. Amelia and I have been brainstorming and doing some research to see what overhauls we can make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly I want to end with an update that my time is still extremely constrained and will likely be this way going forward, so expect longer windows between releases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Added&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added: Ability to delete Smart filter steams from Customize Side Nav and Dashboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added: Ability to rename Smart Filters in Customize settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added: Added the ability to reorder the side nav without using customize screen by clicking the actionable on Home -&amp;gt; Reorder (Thanks @Fesaa)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added: Added a new cleanup task that scans media errors and clears them out if they are ingested fine into Kavita &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added: Added a new preference option for allowing Kavita to automatically switch into webtoon reader mode based on image resolution. Defaults to on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added: Added the ability to see all people across a reading list, the time it would take to read, and age rating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added: Updated many areas of Kavita to bring even better localization support. Everything in the UI should be fully localized now &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added: Added support for partial (0.5) volumes for Korean filename parsing &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Changed&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Allow volume title card overlay for more than just book libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Updated hostname tooltip text to be more clear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Added a toast message for backfilling events on scrobble page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: (Kavita+) Changed button on Scrobbling Errors to a match button which can directly fix the issue, rather than the old edit and add weblink.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Improved the tooltip for the scrobbling button to be clearer if it is on/off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Overhauled the reading list detail page to be more aligned with series detail page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Reading lists will be in non-edit mode by default. A new edit button can toggle edit mode and bring drag handles and other controls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Added a warning when in edit mode about when drag handles are suppressed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: PDFs will now fall back to the Title in metadata for series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Updated Angular to 19 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: (Kavita+) Don't create scrobble events for specials as they will never match on AniList&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Updated wording and some styling to make the first impression better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Changed how series downloads work to include the individual archives instead of unpacking them first (for non-image based series) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Reworked the version update logic so that we don't pop the new version update so often. It will now pop once and if no action is taken, it will wait a week to pop again. The same logic applies to the you are X releases behind, etc (but longer windows).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Updated dependencies and Security issues from downstream libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Enhanced parsing code for (back cover) falsely being recognized as a cover image. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Cleaned up how specials are parsed to allow supporting periods in the Title name &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: (Epub Reader) When reading in Double Column mode, Kavita will now prevent seeing the same text twice by added an empty page when needed &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Allow users to type both localized name and series name to find a match on Related Series &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Made Library type and Sort options dropdowns alphabetical (localized)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Removed the analyze task as it shouldn't be needed anymore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Renamed Comic -&amp;gt; Comic (Legacy) and Comic (Comic Vine) -&amp;gt; Comic. The new comic library should be the primary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Moved the reset button for API Key to the right side, which renders much nicer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Aligned and corrected some styling for the Edit/Close button on setting items to be consistent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Setting items that are not editable won't show the pointer cursor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Setting switch items have the label appropriately wired and thus when you click the label, the switch will update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Details tab will show genre/tags expanded by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: (Kavita+) Updated how JWT looks at expiration time for AniList Token.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Moved Skipped scheduling ScanFolder log message to Trace as it's noisy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Tweaked how localization cache busting is handled to try and get Transloco to respect cache busting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: For Admins (or users with access to all libraries), under Manage Users, sharing now shows 'All Libraries'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Changed how epubs are parsed. Now, Kavita will try to open it expecting a valid epub structure (which isn't common without user intervention) then allow falling back to a non-correct epub (with degraded experience within Kavita). Kavita will record issue in the Media Issues tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Ensure all switch elements link up with a label element for accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: (Kavita+) Switched Last modified to Created for when the scrobble reading event took place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Reading lists' age rating will now update when a series age rating is updated via the UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Moved Gmail/Outlook auto fill buttons from Host Name to Host setting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed: Setting items will auto focus when switching into edit mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Fixed&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed an issue with non-American date and number parsing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed an initial blank page on settings due to a slow locale cache load&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixes the environment variable for invariant globalization still being set in the Dockerfile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed a bug where cbl import wouldn't allow importing due to the name clashing with another user, when it should have only checked your account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed a lot of styling across the app and overall polish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed a bug when updating email settings, it can error out after 2 changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed an issue where chapter ranges (1-3) could get an incorrect sort order &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed an issue with Mihon over-extracting image files (Thanks @arition)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed a missing action handler for delete chapter from series detail page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed issues with selection on mobile devices in the epub reader causing pages to skip &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed TitleSort being used instead of SeriesSort for Series Sort field  (Thanks @joshuaavalon for the help)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Moved loading icon up so it's visible even when having a lot of cards on library detail page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Improved the webtoon reader's ability to ensure chapters are marked as read from continuous reader which caused the last page to not get marked as read. (Thanks @reinar for the spur)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed a bug in edit list that would break the UI when any comma separated values were used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed read more for chinese text &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed tooltips on series card getting overlapped (Thanks @therobbiedavis )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: (Kavita+) Fixed an issue where some people's metadata could have broken urls due to an @ symbol in the url for their description&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed up the webtoon detection algorithm to be more robust &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed the scrobbling page not having working sorting &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed locale response being empty on first load (Thanks @nevivurn)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed PDF specials using filename instead of embedded metadata as title&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed the changelog for API/Removed having an extra -&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Fixed a bug in the update series metadata where you wouldn't be able to clear out people field.&lt;/li&gt;

    <content>&lt;p&gt;One more super small hotfix for an issue where some users were unable to update General Settings due to IP Address not being correctly set on Startup. Thanks to those on the Github Issue that joined discord. It was not easy to reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Fixed&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: Finally fixed a bug where when IP Address was empty (default), the General settings changes would not save&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed: IP Address will now show the default value when empty. &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>New release for Kavita: v0.8.7 - Comic Metadata Downloading, Reading Profiles, Browse by Genre and More</title>
    <updated>2025-07-05T16:08:58-04:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;This was supposed to be Scanner Improvements, but due to my 2 week holiday in the middle, then getting massively distracted when I got back, we ended up with some nice features instead. This release is feature packed with a ton of Feature Requests: Comic Metadata for Kavita+, Reading Profiles, Expanded Browse by support, Koreader Sync Support, Ability to disable metadata parsing (for those that want the old pdf parser), a revamped Mihon extension, and much more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get started, I first want to announce that @Fesaa has officially joined the Kavita team. She has been a strong and continuous contributor for the last few months, she's also is behind one of the most requested FRs (Reading Profiles). Really excited to continue our work together to make Kavita the best software out there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Comic Metadata (Kavita+)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="438843284-0fac5031-db71-48c6-9bde-0eaae1a2fb1c" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e394d3fe-e56c-49ab-ae2b-7675b5aee4d2" /&gt;
Can you believe everything you see is issue metadata from Kavita+? In this release, I have expanded the metadata downloading functionality to Comics. You get Publisher, Imprint, People roles, Issue-level Reviews (Critic and User), Release Date, Cover Image, Issue Title, Average Rating, and summary. This metadata applies at the &lt;strong&gt;series&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;issue&lt;/strong&gt; level. Data comes from &lt;a href="https://comicbookroundup.com/"&gt;Comic Book Roundup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kavtia+ Comic data also has weekly release data, which is a nice added bonus. I am currently exploring if metadata around TPBs is useful. If you think it is, please create/upvote a FR and provide discussion to validate the work. I look forward to hearing if the Comic metadata is bringing value to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Browse (and filter) People/Genre/Tags&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="455074614-d22a39a1-f92e-443b-aa58-27968d8ccf7a" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce9a32b8-5e2d-4067-b544-f169c9ca3f8b" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="455074644-6c1d2cfa-d92c-40aa-b77b-36a442b3457b" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecf27a0d-c8da-4abd-8d70-29e419d79f73" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this release, I've also expanded the metadata system to People and provided what I thought was valuable items. Surprisingly, this took me about 40 hours to do, but now, the metadata system can work on any entity, so my plans for an issue/chapter page seem more feasible. In addition to this, you can now browse by Genre/Tags. Do note, anything with 0 series will not be further filterable by as there is no issue listing page yet. (You can reach the browse genre/tag screens from your user menu in top right of screen)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading Profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="452782185-0fe8ac41-ecd5-42ef-aabf-2b5b49c09ab2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8acd6566-523b-4a54-abd9-748fede93dcc" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a massive feature delivering on a highly request Feature Request (100 upvotes). I want to thank Amelia for implementing it while I was on my holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading Profiles capture your reader settings (image, pdf, epub) into an entity that can be found to a set of Libraries and Series. With the new system, you can bind a reading profile to a library (say double page to your comic library). Now, whenever you read in that library, the double page reader will be applied. Likewise, you can bind a Reading Profile to a Series as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are Implicit profiles. These aren't visual in the UI, but instead capture any changes that are made mid-reading session. Going forward, any changes made during reading will persist between reading sessions for that series itself. From the readers, you can 'promote' the implicit profile into a manageable (shows in the manage screen). You can also optionally skip the implicit and save to the parent profile (aka the series/library bound profile).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wiki has a great overview on how the new system works. See &lt;a href="https://wiki.kavitareader.com/guides/user-settings/reading-profiles/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An Updated Mihon Extension&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Mihon extension has been updated. The original plugin was written by @ThePromidius, but hasn't been active for some time. @dear-clouds took it upon themselves to update the extension and bring some much needed polish. Here is a bit of a sneak peak to the changes, this is not an extensive list of changes. There is more to come, drop by the &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/BRvY78QMAm"&gt;discord&lt;/a&gt; to share feedback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mihon compatible&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduced a new filter: &lt;strong&gt;Special Lists&lt;/strong&gt; — view your Want to Read or Reading lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom Detail Page for &lt;strong&gt;Reading Lists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Option to automatically update the cover to match the latest volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Fork Only&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[Komikku] Suggestions display all related titles first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[Komikku] Reading List suggestions now show all the list's items first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Options to use GroupTags with multiple categories when available: Type (Library name) ; Demographic ; Genres ; Tags (works only on Forks that support this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90f38a4a-daee-4826-9637-a2d026df1b05" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Koreader Sync Support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finally were able to get the Koreader Sync Support PR merged. A huge shoutout to the developers and testers that helped get this ready for Stable. This is enabled by default and currently works on epubs (if you need archives, raise a FR). You can read up about this feature on the &lt;a href="https://wiki.kavitareader.com/guides/3rdparty/koreader/#koreader"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Misc Stuff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a ton of smaller changes that I wanted to make sure I call out. 
1. Actionables across the app are now smarter. Instead of showing add and remove from collection, it will check the status and only present options that are applicable. 
2. Libraries by default will not import collections/reading lists from ComicInfo (Manage Collections/Reading Lists). Many support issues arose and since most of the community recommends using the CBL project, it makes sense to make this opt-in.
3. There was a lot of bugfixing and polish around Kavita+ this release. Hopefully most issues plaguing users are solved. 
4. Again, if you want to get to the browse genre/tag screens, you can get to it here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/792703ee-eaa6-40b5-a588-0a9965953a2f" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that said, next release we are not working on the Scanner improvements. Instead, we have decided to take inspiration from this release and focus primarily on Feature Requests and take another look at how Kavita+ integrates into Kavita along with switching to MangaBaka as a data source for metadata. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Added&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added: Users can now use the shortcut Ctrl+K to open the search window&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added: Users can now add ratings and reviews at a per-issue/chapter level. For Volumes that are 1 file (books), any rating/review will transfer to the underlying chapter and be seemless). Book and Comic users are the primary audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added: Kavita+ can now download ratings and reviews for individual comic issues (CBR). Ratings and Reviews for Comics come in Critic and User reviews and will show appropriately in the UI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added: (Kavita+) Kavita can now download series and issue metadata from ComicBookRoundup. New settings for each Chapter-level item.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Added: Added the ability to browse all Genres and Tags in the Server (FR #3173, 5 votes)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Added: (Kavita+) Scrobbling items can now be deleted in case you accidentally created one&lt;/li&gt;
