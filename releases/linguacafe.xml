    <content>&lt;p&gt;Please backup LinguaCafe before updating, otherwise you can lose your data if anything goes wrong. You can read more about backups in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/simjanos-dev/LinguaCafe/wiki/2.-Setup#backup"&gt;user manual&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read the previous(v0.13.1) update notes, and only update accordingly to its description, since Turkish is still not fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

- Fixed website import.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thank you for everyone who contributed for the release!&lt;/h2&gt;</content>

    <title>New release for LinguaCafe: v0.14</title>
    <updated>2025-03-18T12:14:47-04:00</updated>
    <author>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;Make sure you backup LinguaCafe before updating, otherwise you can lose your data if anything goes wrong. You can read more about backups in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/simjanos-dev/LinguaCafe/wiki/2.-Setup#backup"&gt;user manual&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important changes:&lt;/strong&gt;
- The update process has been extended with an extra step: you must also download the latest docker-compose.yml file. This time multiple things were changed, but I'll try to provide a list of further changes in the future, so people won't have to check their custom setups for every version.
- LinguaCafe has started using local storage instead of cookies and has a new text styling system, this means that all of your local settings will reset to default when you first start using this version. 
- 6001 port has been added to the webserver  for websockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New features:&lt;/strong&gt;
- Added queue based chapter imports. From now on you won't have to wait for your chapters to be imported, it will happen in the background. If you open a book, the chapters will be updated in real time after the importing is finished.
- Dictionary import progress bar now shows real time progress.
- Added new online translation service: MyMemories.
- Added new offline, self hosted translation service: LibreTranslate.
- Added an API to connect custom scripts and translation services to LinguaCafe.
- Replaced cookies with local storage. This means that your local settings will reset to default settings.
- Added level to hover vocabulary box for highlighted words.
- Added .webp support for book cover images.
- Added auto theme switching based on system theme.
- Added an export database button to the admin page.
- Added automatic daily database backups.
- Added a change password button to the user settings.
- Added a button that lets users delete all their data related to their selected language.
- Added a statistic that shows the users known unique lemmas.
- Added fully customizable interactive text styling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug fixes:&lt;/strong&gt;
- Book word counts did not update after deleting a chapter.
- Text reader's light theme glossary word colors were not displayed correctly.
- Text reader's glossary displayed "2" instead of "new" for new words.
- Development tools page had incorrect background for light theme.
- Book word count percentages were displayed incorrectly in empty books and chapters.
- Fixed inconsistencies in custom themes when the user selected different foreground color.
- The selected font type was not applied to the hover vocabulary's reading section.
- The selected font type was not applied to the text reader's title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other changes:&lt;/strong&gt;
- Updated to Laravel 11.
- Replaced default book cover image.
- Replaced switches with checkboxes on the vocabulary export page.
- Removed simple text parsing method. It was something needed before v0.1, because import times were very slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thank you for everyone who contributed for the release!&lt;/h2&gt;</content>
