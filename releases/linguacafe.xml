    <content>&lt;p&gt;Please backup LinguaCafe before updating, otherwise you can lose your data if anything goes wrong. You can read more about backups in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/simjanos-dev/LinguaCafe/wiki/2.-Setup#backup"&gt;user manual&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a problem with the Turkish package. This update will fix it temporarily, however it will break import functions for every other language if Turkish is installed. It can only be fixed by using a different Turkish tokenizer, which will take a while to implement. This update is for people who tried to install Turkish and was unable to, and do not use other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't update if you:
- use Turkish already and it is working
- don't use Turkish and don't want to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can downgrade to v0.13 by creating a &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file next to the &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; file, and adding this line to it: &lt;code&gt;VERSION=13.0&lt;/code&gt;, then running the update command again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug fixes:&lt;/strong&gt;
- Turkish temporary fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New bugs:&lt;/strong&gt;
- Forgot to change the version display in the software to v0.13.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thank you for everyone who contributed for the release!&lt;/h2&gt;</content>

    <title>New release for LinguaCafe: v0.14</title>
    <updated>2025-03-18T12:14:47-04:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;Make sure you backup LinguaCafe before updating, otherwise you can lose your data if anything goes wrong. You can read more about backups in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/simjanos-dev/LinguaCafe/wiki/2.-Setup#backup"&gt;user manual&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important changes:&lt;/strong&gt;
- The update process has been extended with an extra step: you must also download the latest docker-compose.yml file. This time multiple things were changed, but I'll try to provide a list of further changes in the future, so people won't have to check their custom setups for every version.
- LinguaCafe has started using local storage instead of cookies and has a new text styling system, this means that all of your local settings will reset to default when you first start using this version. 
- 6001 port has been added to the webserver  for websockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New features:&lt;/strong&gt;
- Added queue based chapter imports. From now on you won't have to wait for your chapters to be imported, it will happen in the background. If you open a book, the chapters will be updated in real time after the importing is finished.
- Dictionary import progress bar now shows real time progress.
- Added new online translation service: MyMemories.
- Added new offline, self hosted translation service: LibreTranslate.
- Added an API to connect custom scripts and translation services to LinguaCafe.
- Replaced cookies with local storage. This means that your local settings will reset to default settings.
- Added level to hover vocabulary box for highlighted words.
- Added .webp support for book cover images.
- Added auto theme switching based on system theme.
- Added an export database button to the admin page.
- Added automatic daily database backups.
- Added a change password button to the user settings.
- Added a button that lets users delete all their data related to their selected language.
- Added a statistic that shows the users known unique lemmas.
- Added fully customizable interactive text styling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug fixes:&lt;/strong&gt;
- Book word counts did not update after deleting a chapter.
- Text reader's light theme glossary word colors were not displayed correctly.
- Text reader's glossary displayed "2" instead of "new" for new words.
- Development tools page had incorrect background for light theme.
- Book word count percentages were displayed incorrectly in empty books and chapters.
- Fixed inconsistencies in custom themes when the user selected different foreground color.
- The selected font type was not applied to the hover vocabulary's reading section.
- The selected font type was not applied to the text reader's title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other changes:&lt;/strong&gt;
- Updated to Laravel 11.
- Replaced default book cover image.
- Replaced switches with checkboxes on the vocabulary export page.
- Removed simple text parsing method. It was something needed before v0.1, because import times were very slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thank you for everyone who contributed for the release!&lt;/h2&gt;</content>
