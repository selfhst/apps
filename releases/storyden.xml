    <content>&lt;p&gt;This release introduces lots of experimental new language model features. These features are still in flux but are being used in production for a private London-based social club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating nodes from assets using text-extraction and summarisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Links to fill content for nodes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scoring similarity between nodes-nodes or nodes-profiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;This release focuses on performance and customisation. With Roles and Permissions, administrators can now more finely control access and allow moderators to customise the instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In AI, there's a brand new chunking engine for more fine grained embedding of content, this improves search and recommendations by orders of magnitude. It also includes better support for small deployments that want to make use of AI features, you can now deploy a Storyden container with zero dependencies and full vector database and LLM feature support. It also improves deployment of full-stack containers by removing the need to build the frontend from source to customise its environment variables. This change also introduces a new API and UI feature: Asker, which allows members to ask basic one-shot questions to an LLM that includes context from the instance such as related pages and threads posted by members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Changelog&lt;/strong&gt;: https://github.com/Southclaws/storyden/compare/v1.24.2...v1.24.3&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>New release for Storyden: v1.25.1</title>
    <updated>2025-07-12T06:20:10-04:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;Storyden now uses versioned releases!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this stable versions landed directly on &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; and users would just pull the most recent. Now the project is maturing and gaining more traction, we've decided to start using a version numbering strategy with clearly identified version milestones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try out Storyden right now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sh
docker run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/southclaws/storyden&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first version is v1.25.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt; - we're stable, we've been stable for a while but this communicates that clearly, "1" will be the major version number going forward as we don't plan huge rewrites/changes to the current state of the product. This being said, breaking API changes may occur, while it's avoided as much as possible, semantic versioning is not fit for purpose here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;25&lt;/code&gt; 2025, year based so you can clearly see what's recent and what's rather old, inspired by Windows and Ubuntu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; - this is the first release of 2025, this number will simply increment with each release.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this format is "semantic versioning" compatible in terms of layout, we do not follow the rules of semantic versioning for a few technical reasons. This format however keeps package registries (PyPi, npm, etc client libraries are coming soon!), tooling and application directories happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, here's an AI slop generated change log that's pretty much meaningless. For an overview of features, please see the official documentation: https://www.storyden.org/docs/introduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Don't worry, future releases will have clear change logs!)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content>&lt;h1&gt;Improvements for directory sites&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This change introduces some minor additions that make running primarily directory/knowledgebase focused community sites easier. Two top-line items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can now more deeply customise the home page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More sorting and filtering options on page tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Home page customisation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://github.com/Southclaws/storyden/pull/462&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've used the beautiful new Library Page layouts to build community-curated directories (which you can also automate using n8n, MCP and API via the new &lt;a href="https://www.storyden.org/docs/operation/access-keys"&gt;Access Tokens&lt;/a&gt;!) such as this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e1fc723-a33c-4754-bfa9-32ec43c32b8a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now make one of these pages the home page, if you're less about the forum vibes and more about a directory of curated links/pages/content using the new "Admin" zone in the Navigation Pane on the left while using the desktop view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c870b87-18e6-4a00-a9c7-f25ae84fc9f1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This use-case will continue to improve in upcoming releases, a short roadmap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filter pages in a table by tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search pages in a table by simple keyword or (maybe) semantic search and if I'm feeling extra spicy: an LLM Asker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More layouts for child pages than just a table, card grids and all sorts of pretty things (still filterable/searchable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;implement missing filtering options for node children&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://github.com/Southclaws/storyden/pull/463&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, in a child page table you could only sort by custom properties, this release fixes that by enabling sorting by "Fixed" fields. Those are the fields inherent to pages like its name, link or description. More fixed fields will be added in future releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width="753" height="461" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3759497-dac2-47af-a84f-079e44c3af14" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(also shout out UK Festival Directory, a new user of Storyden!)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content>&lt;h1&gt;Fix OAuth2 provider &lt;code&gt;redirect_uri&lt;/code&gt; construction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This addresses an issue with the OAuth2 providers where the &lt;code&gt;redirect_uri&lt;/code&gt; was not formed correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some context on this issue: originally, the API code would construct the redirect URI but the goal was always to shift this responsibility to the client (frontend) and the reason for that is to segregate knowledge of each system and decouple the API from potential separate frontend implementations. Due to this coupling, it means that developers who wish to take advantage of Storyden's ability to run as a headless API and build a fully custom frontend would need to adhere to the exact OAuth callback URL structure for their frontend implementation. This is not desirable as it leaks details about the API and enforces a specific web page structure on clients. This was unfortunately never finished and this bug slipped in when the URL construction logic was removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, the original functionality has been restored, the API is still responsible for constructing the redirect URI for OAuth2 flow initialisation URLs and this means custom frontends still need to adhere to this structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future this will be revisited and clients will be able to control the exact callback URL removing this dependency on the API. Until then, frontends that wish to implement OAuth2 will need to adhere to the following route structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/auth/{provider}/callback&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;{provider}&lt;/code&gt; is one of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;oauth_google&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;oauth_github&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;oauth_discord&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fix OAuth2 redirect URI construction by @Southclaws in https://github.com/Southclaws/storyden/pull/466&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
