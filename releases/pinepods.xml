    <content>&lt;p&gt;Preferably, you won't notice much in this update other than the app being much more stable. This update is here to bug fix and cleanup little issues that have existed forever. Highlights include a home button that pops up when not on the home page to quickly return. Refreshing reloads correctly on every page now. Not to mention, it's now possible to share podcasts with other users on your server! You can open a podcast page and send them the url of a podcast you're currently on. It will open right up to that particular podcast for them. An example link looks like this: 
http://try.pinepods.online/episode_layout?podcast_title=Ship%20It%21%20SRE%2C%20Platform%20Engineering%2C%20DevOps&amp;amp;podcast_url=https%3A%2F%2Fchangelog.com%2Fshipit%2Ffeed
Keep in mind that will only work on your particular server. So that link above will always open that link on the Pinepods trial server. You must be logged in for links to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Added a fallback to the opml import for when the opml file uses text instead of title for the podcast name key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Added a new route for the version tag that dynamically updates when the application is compiled. This allows for automation around the version numbers all based around the the Github release tag as the original source of truth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Fixed layout for podcasts when searching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Support floating point chapters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Fixed issue with white space at the bottom of every page #229&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Cleaned up incorrect or not needed logging at startup #219&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Fixed issue with user stats page where it would lose user context on reload #135&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Fixed issue with settings page where it would lose user context on reload #134&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Fixed issue with episode_layout page where it would lose user context on reload and also made podcasts sharable via link #213&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Fixed issue where podcast episode counts wouldn't increment after initial add to the db&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Ugraded gloo::net to 0.6.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Upgraded openssl in src-tauri to 0.10.66&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Upgraded a few other rust depends to next minor version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Added loading spinner to custom feed and implemented more clear success message&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Fixed postgres return issue on user_stats route&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Fixed postgres return issue on mfa return route&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Fixed delete api key route for postgres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Implemented adjustment on all modals throughout the app so clicking outside them closes them (episode layout confiramtions missing yet - also test all login modals)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Implemented adjustment on all modals so that they overlap everything in the app (This was causing issues on small screens)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Added Confirmation dialog modal to podcast deletion on /podcasts layout page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Changed name of bt user to background_tasks to make the user more clear on api key settings display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content>

    <title>New release for PinePods: Version 0.6.5 Released! Manual refresh, imrproved layouts, and various features!</title>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;This update tackles quite a few various features that have been asked for quite a bit. Podcast feeds with user and pass now work and can be easily added, the episode layout page can now handle podcast additions and removals much more gracefully, and you can now manually refresh podcasts! There's a button right on the home screen to quickly run a refresh. Plenty of additional fixes and cleanups have been completed in addition. Features are starting to slow somewhat as I start do everything I can to ensure a really polished experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Fixed issue with Podcasts page not refreshing correctly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Added Add Custom Feed to Podcasts page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Allow for podcast feeds with user and pass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Add option to add podcast from feed on podcasts page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Ensure podcast loads onto podcast page when adding a new custom one in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Adjusted buttons on episode layout page so they dynamically adjust position to fit better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Option for user to manually update feeds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Update Feed directly after adding a Nextcloud/gpodder sync server instead of waiting for the next refresh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Fixed issue with episode refreshing where a panic could occur (This was due to the categories list)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Ensured See More Button only shows when needed (Just made the descriptions clickable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Fixed issue with context for podcasts not dynamically updating on the episode layout page once the podcast was added to the db&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Fixed issue with nextcloud sync on mysql dbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Fixed issue with db setup with mysql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[x] Ensured deleting podcast when on the episode layout page it closes the deleted modal&lt;/li&gt;
