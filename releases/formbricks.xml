    <content>&lt;p&gt;Formbricks v2.6 introduces advanced logic jumps for surveys, allowing you to add more advanced branching logic to your surveys including variables, and/or conditions and many more. This release also includes a lot of bug fixes, big performance improvements to website and app surveys and a lot of stability improvements 🚀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all the contributors who help make Formbricks more robust and performant. 💪🙏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!IMPORTANT]  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Server-side action deprecation ⚠️&lt;/strong&gt; This release includes the last step of the server-side action tracking deprecation (previously used for segment filtering by performed actions). The migrations included in this release will delete all tracked actions from the database. If you still need these action records, please make sure to export them before upgrading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!IMPORTANT]  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Data migration required ⚠️&lt;/strong&gt; This release includes a data migration to handle skipped CTA responses. Please follow the &lt;a href="https://formbricks.com/docs/self-hosting/migration-guide"&gt;instructions on the Migration page&lt;/a&gt; in the docs to learn how to run the data migration needed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New release for Formbricks: v2.7.0</title>
    <updated>2024-11-08T06:41:56-05:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>formbricks/formbricks</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;p&gt;Formbricks v2.7 includes all the features and improvements developed by the community during Hacktoberfest 2024 🔥.
With this release, Formbricks is not only available in English, but also in German and Brazilian Portuguese 🇩🇪🇧🇷&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also introduce an advanced team-based access control system (requires Formbricks Enterprise Edition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all the contributors who help make Formbricks more robust and powerful. 💪🙏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!IMPORTANT]  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Database update ⚠️&lt;/strong&gt; This release sets the foundation for our upcoming AI features, currently in private beta. Formbricks now
  requires the &lt;code&gt;pgvector&lt;/code&gt; extension to be installed in the PostgreSQL database. For users of our one-click
  setup, simply use the &lt;code&gt;pgvector/pgvector:pg15&lt;/code&gt; image instead of &lt;code&gt;postgres:15-alpine&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!IMPORTANT]  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Data migration required ⚠️&lt;/strong&gt; This release includes a data migration to handle the changes on the access role feature. Please follow the &lt;a href="https://formbricks.com/docs/self-hosting/migration-guide"&gt;instructions on the Migration page&lt;/a&gt; in the docs to learn how to run the data migration needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>New release for Formbricks: v3.0.0</title>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;We're thrilled to announce the release of Formbricks 3.0, packed with powerful new features and improvements that make gathering insights and creating exceptional experiences easier than ever. 🎉🎉🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[!IMPORTANT]  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Don't upgrade to 3.0 if you need SSO, user identification or cluster support on the community edition!&lt;/strong&gt;
With Formbricks 3.0, we're making some strategic changes to ensure long-term sustainability while keeping our core commitment to open source. While the Community Edition &lt;a href="https://formbricks.com/blog/formbricks-3-0"&gt;got more powerful&lt;/a&gt;, we're moving &lt;a href="https://formbricks.com/docs/self-hosting/license"&gt;some advanced features&lt;/a&gt; to the Enterprise Edition.
If you upgrade to 3.0 and run the data migration, there IS NO WAY BACK to 2.7.2 - if you need to use SSO or one of the other previously free features, either stick with 2.7.x or &lt;a href="mailto:hola@formbricks.com"&gt;reach out&lt;/a&gt; for a custom quote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Major new features ✨&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our small team, we keep working hard to make Formbricks better for everyone: Our community as well as our Enterprise customers. Here are the highlights of Formbricks 3.0:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-language support&lt;/strong&gt;: 🌍 Complete UI now available in English, French, German, and Portuguese. Need another language? &lt;a href="mailto:hola@formbricks.com"&gt;Get in touch 👋&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email Follow-ups&lt;/strong&gt;: 📧 Automatically send custom follow-up emails to your respondents, team mates or yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New "Contact" question type&lt;/strong&gt;: 📝 Capture and analyze contact information from your surveys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Insights&lt;/strong&gt;: 🤖 Public beta for AI Insights generation for free text responses (BYO model on self-hosted)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formbricks Wordpress Plugin&lt;/strong&gt;: 🔌 Embed surveys in your WordPress site with ease, &lt;a href="https://formbricks.com/blog/wordpress-surveys-plugin"&gt;learn more here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teams and Access Rights&lt;/strong&gt;: 👥 Manage your team and access rights to specific surveys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formbricks Cluster support &amp;amp; Helm Chart&lt;/strong&gt;: ⚓ Deploy Formbricks on Kubernetes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Logic&lt;/strong&gt;: 🧮 Add more complex logic to your surveys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variables&lt;/strong&gt;: 🔢 Add text and numeric variables to keep track of scores, prices, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;/strong&gt;: ⚡ Decrease for in-product survey server load by ~80%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic Migrations&lt;/strong&gt;:✨ Makes upgrading to future versions of Formbricks a breeze.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better filters, templates, and tons of bug fixes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
