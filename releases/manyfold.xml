    <title>New release for Manyfold: v0.105.0</title>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;This release sees the first proper API endpoints for public models, creators and collections. It's a pretty standard JSON-LD REST API, and should be considered version zero; it will definitely change over time, but we're excited to see what can be done with it! Full documentation is at &lt;code&gt;/api&lt;/code&gt; on every instance (including on &lt;a href="https://try.manyfold.app/api"&gt;Try Manyfold&lt;/a&gt;), and is linked in the site footer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authenticated access tokens for accessing private data will be coming soon, followed by being able to edit data and upload content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>New release for Manyfold: v0.106.0</title>
    <updated>2025-04-01T06:56:12-04:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;There's a HUGE changelist in this release, because we've spent some time on a whole load of features for people running public servers as well as the usual collection of bugfixes and minor improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the appearance and customisation options are now built in to the settings pages, so the old SITE_NAME environment variables have gone away; you can also open and close signups from within settings. There's a new about page, a place to specify server rules and a donation link, and a change to how site statistics are displayed which makes more sense for big instances. Add on email notifications, editable fediverse usernames, and the list gets pretty huge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have a brand new translation into Czech, courtesy of @ichlubna, bringing us to 6 languages now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's quite a big UI change though - you may notice that libraries have disappeared. We found that in general people don't use them for organisation, and on public instances they're confusing, so we've hidden them away by default. Now they're really just a way to configure storage locations. You can set default library for uploads, and admins can still move models between libraries. Don't worry though, if you want it back how it was before, you can enable the previous behaviour in the site appearance settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;💥 Breaking Changes 💥&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hide libraries by default, with admin option to show them again by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/3848&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Require moderator approval for signups by default by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/3860&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;✨ New Features ✨&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change user fediverse handles to editable username by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/3839&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add editing for creator slugs (aka fedi usernames) by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/3844&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add setting for default library, used when uploading by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/3846&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>New release for Manyfold: v0.107.0</title>
    <updated>2025-04-09T11:44:30-04:00</updated>
    <author>
      <name>manyfold3d/manyfold</name>
    </author>
    <content>&lt;p&gt;This release adds some handy new features. First, Manyfold now imports metadata from a datapackage.json file, both on upload and scan. One thing this means is that if you lose your database, you should be able to recover most of your data from the files that are stored on disk along with the models! The other big thing is that now we have API authentication using OAuth; you can create a set of OAuth application credentials, and then use them to access private data using the existing read APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also got a new social following page, support for federated unfollows and deletes, support for opening in ElegooSlicer and SuperSlicer, support for HFP and SLDPRT, a new theme, and the usual pile of bugfixes and minor improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>New release for Manyfold: v0.108.0</title>
    <updated>2025-04-15T09:39:25-04:00</updated>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content>&lt;p&gt;This release is all about the API! We've had a read-only API for a few releases now, but this release brings the ability to update and create data as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you'll need to create an OAuth application in the settings area, with the appropriate scopes. You can then use it to create, edit and delete all the basic data for creators and collections, and update metadata for models and files. That means that, for instance, you could write a script to import data from another hosting site. The best way to explore the API is to try it live from the API documentation; just click "Authorise" and paste in your app credentials!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that aren't in there yet; problems, permissions, admin capabilities, and you can't yet upload new files, but all that will be coming in future releases, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;💥 Breaking Changes 💥&lt;/h3&gt;
