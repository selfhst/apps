    <content>&lt;p&gt;Two main features in this release: first, you can now customise the ignored files and folders list for disk scanning, which should help keep things tidy; and second, we've got more federation support for creator profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you follow a creator on another Manyfold instance, it will appear in your local creator list, and you can assign models to it, as well as easily visiting the original profile. You can also search for Fediverse addresses straight from the main search box - try following &lt;code&gt;@floppy@manyfold.floppy.org.uk&lt;/code&gt; to see it in action!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's more federation work coming soon, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;✨ New Features ✨&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include followed remote creators in list by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/3478&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure files / directories that should be ignored during scan by @matthewbadeau in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/3434&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entering fediverse username in main search redirects to follow page by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/3490&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;🐛 Bug Fixes 🐛&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix problems with searching for remote fediverse users by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/3488&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use simpler regexp output for file settings form by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/3489&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;🛠️ Other Improvements 🛠️&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store activitypub extension data for remote actors by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/3472&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include creator caption and notes in activitystream summary by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/3473&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add creator links as attachments in activitystreams by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/3477&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Order libraries by name, by default by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/3481&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reorganise creator display a little for remote creators by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/3482&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rename extension namespace to f3di by @Floppy in https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/3483&lt;/li&gt;

    <content>&lt;p&gt;Two HUGE milestones this release; proper federation between Manyfold instances, AND it's our 100th feature release! 🎂  🎉 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let's talk about federation. For a while we've had limited federation over ActivityPub; you could follow Manyfold creators from Fediverse platforms like Mastodon and see updates from them, like when they create a new model. But now, Manyfold instances (that enable federation) can connect together to natively share information. If you follow a Creator, Model, or Collection on another Manyfold instance, that thing will now appear in your instance's listings, and you'll see updates in the main page activity feed! For instance, here's a Creator that's on a different instance; you can see it has all the same data, and shows that it's from a different server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width="391" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-12 at 09 41 39" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/275e610b-f281-46ed-80b9-0b132b98bdf5" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This really is the big step towards our goal of building a decentralised alternative to the hosting sites like Thingiverse; you can now host your own content, and link up easily to content that others are also self hosting. It's all very exciting! There's more to come, plenty more features add on, but this is a massive step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manyfold has been on quite the journey to this, the 100th feature release; it started just over 4 years ago, in January 2021, as a side project to help @Floppy organise his model folder. Since then it grew organically for a few years, but then in January 2024 got a huge boost when we got funding from &lt;a href="https://nlnet.nl"&gt;NLNet&lt;/a&gt; and the EU &lt;a href="https://ngi.eu/ngi-projects/ngi-zero/"&gt;NGI Zero&lt;/a&gt; project, enabling full-time work on it. That's taken it from a side project to a proper tool, with thousands of weekly downloads, over 50 &lt;em&gt;known&lt;/em&gt; instances running (and that's just the ones reporting in!), translation into five languages, and an informal network of contributors who write code, translate text, provide peer support, and generally keep us going!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We couldn't be more thankful to everyone who's helped us get this far; we literally couldn't have done it without all of you. From here, we're just going to keep building, powered by a second grant just started from NLNet / NGI Zero, with a v1.0 release "soon", and with lots of great new features in the pipeline! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you all ❤️ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
