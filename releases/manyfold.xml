    <title>New release for Manyfold: v0.99.0</title>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;Two main features in this release: first, you can now customise the ignored files and folders list for disk scanning, which should help keep things tidy; and second, we've got more federation support for creator profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you follow a creator on another Manyfold instance, it will appear in your local creator list, and you can assign models to it, as well as easily visiting the original profile. You can also search for Fediverse addresses straight from the main search box - try following &lt;code&gt;@floppy@manyfold.floppy.org.uk&lt;/code&gt; to see it in action!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's more federation work coming soon, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;✨ New Features ✨&lt;/h3&gt;

    <title>New release for Manyfold: v0.100.0</title>
    <updated>2025-02-12T04:55:13-05:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;Two HUGE milestones this release; proper federation between Manyfold instances, AND it's our 100th feature release! 🎂  🎉 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let's talk about federation. For a while we've had limited federation over ActivityPub; you could follow Manyfold creators from Fediverse platforms like Mastodon and see updates from them, like when they create a new model. But now, Manyfold instances (that enable federation) can connect together to natively share information. If you follow a Creator, Model, or Collection on another Manyfold instance, that thing will now appear in your instance's listings, and you'll see updates in the main page activity feed! For instance, here's a Creator that's on a different instance; you can see it has all the same data, and shows that it's from a different server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width="391" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-12 at 09 41 39" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/275e610b-f281-46ed-80b9-0b132b98bdf5" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This really is the big step towards our goal of building a decentralised alternative to the hosting sites like Thingiverse; you can now host your own content, and link up easily to content that others are also self hosting. It's all very exciting! There's more to come, plenty more features add on, but this is a massive step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manyfold has been on quite the journey to this, the 100th feature release; it started just over 4 years ago, in January 2021, as a side project to help @Floppy organise his model folder. Since then it grew organically for a few years, but then in January 2024 got a huge boost when we got funding from &lt;a href="https://nlnet.nl"&gt;NLNet&lt;/a&gt; and the EU &lt;a href="https://ngi.eu/ngi-projects/ngi-zero/"&gt;NGI Zero&lt;/a&gt; project, enabling full-time work on it. That's taken it from a side project to a proper tool, with thousands of weekly downloads, over 50 &lt;em&gt;known&lt;/em&gt; instances running (and that's just the ones reporting in!), translation into five languages, and an informal network of contributors who write code, translate text, provide peer support, and generally keep us going!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We couldn't be more thankful to everyone who's helped us get this far; we literally couldn't have done it without all of you. From here, we're just going to keep building, powered by a second grant just started from NLNet / NGI Zero, with a v1.0 release "soon", and with lots of great new features in the pipeline! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you all ❤️ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;✨ New Features ✨&lt;/h3&gt;

    <content>&lt;p&gt;Now that Manyfold instances can connect to each other, it might be pretty handy to be able to tell which one you're looking at. So, we've now got themes! You can easily select one of 26 different looks for your instance, thanks to the great &lt;a href="https://bootswatch.com"&gt;Bootswatch&lt;/a&gt; theme collection. Just go to the new "appearance" settings page to choose your favourite!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also got the usual bugfixes, but there's one really big one; we can now render 3MF files that use the "production extension" properly! So, if you've saved your slicer projects as 3MF, downloaded something with print information already added, or had another sort of 3MF file that wasn't rendering, hopefully you'll find it's now working properly!&lt;/p&gt;
