&lt;h3&gt;Release name&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing &lt;code&gt;-v focal-270&lt;/code&gt; to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install/v2.7.x-release/bbb-install.sh will always install the latest released BigBlueButton 2.7 version.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If for some reason you would like to install this specific release, pass &lt;code&gt;-v focal-270-2.7.13&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still recommend using &lt;code&gt;-v focal-270&lt;/code&gt; as this repository is continually updated with each BigBlueButton 2.7 release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Client build: 350&lt;/h3&gt;</content>
