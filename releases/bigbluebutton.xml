    <title>New release for BigBlueButton: v3.0.7</title>
    <updated>2025-05-12T11:29:48-04:00</updated>

    <content>&lt;p&gt;The main focus of this iteration are improvements to the breakout rooms, external video (youtube) share and presentation conversion.
LiveKit support has been improved and some whiteboard edge cases have been handled. For those who had previously set up the LiveKit integration, we recommend reviewing the installation steps as there may be actions needed regarding recording and network configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Some BigBlueButton plugins now support other languages. If you are seeing things like "pickRandomUserPlugin.actionsButtonDropdown.label.pickUser" instead of the label, check for a newer tag/version of the plugin on github. We welcome translation contributions to the plugins as we are propagating the translation support.&lt;/p&gt;
