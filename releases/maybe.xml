    <content>&lt;h2&gt;Plaid Integration + Multi-currency Investment Portfolio Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have completed the first pass at our fully automated bank syncing with Plaid on our &lt;em&gt;hosted version&lt;/em&gt; of the app!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated bank syncing is a huge milestone for the app and includes many UI improvements, accuracy improvements, and bug fixes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Editing transactions is now much smoother&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Account history can be calculated chronologically and reverse-chronologically (required for Plaid accounts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-currency investment accounts are now available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investment accounts now properly calculate "brokerage cash" vs. "holdings value" and break this out clearly in the view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investment accounts calculate cost basis more accurately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="CleanShot 2024-12-13 at 12 31 03" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fdbab79-7bc5-4631-80b4-a708df1783fd" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Can I self-host Plaid?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an open-source project, self-hosters are more than welcome to configure (and pay for) their own Plaid accounts.  You can see the &lt;code&gt;.env.example&lt;/code&gt; file for the required api keys that need to be provided to the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, due to the complexity around OAuth, Plaid's pricing structure, and costs associated with a personal Plaid subscription, we will not be officially supporting this setup.  The hosted version of our app has full Plaid support and is our recommended way to get access to automated bank syncing (more invites coming soon!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;

    <content>&lt;h2&gt;Budgeting is here!&lt;/h2&gt;

    <content>&lt;h2&gt;Data resets, offline investment trades, and miscellaneous stability improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release comes with a wide mix of stability improvements and quality of life updates; particularly for self hosted apps, which can now be "reset" in user settings.  If your data looks wrong or you want a "clean slate" to work from, we've added the ability for you to easily perform these resets without writing SQL or manually deleting records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release also comes with a much clearer UI surrounding the Synth data provider.  New self hosted users will now see a prominent warning message if they have missing data as a result of a misconfigured or absent data provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Changed&lt;/h2&gt;
