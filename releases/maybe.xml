    <content>&lt;h2&gt;Data resets, offline investment trades, and miscellaneous stability improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release comes with a wide mix of stability improvements and quality of life updates; particularly for self hosted apps, which can now be "reset" in user settings.  If your data looks wrong or you want a "clean slate" to work from, we've added the ability for you to easily perform these resets without writing SQL or manually deleting records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release also comes with a much clearer UI surrounding the Synth data provider.  New self hosted users will now see a prominent warning message if they have missing data as a result of a misconfigured or absent data provider.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content>&lt;h1&gt;Farewell... Maybe :wave:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="maybe-meet-again" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa233d64-759c-485a-b928-f17c4604e57d" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/Shpigford/status/1947725345244709240"&gt;Maybe is pivoting to B2B financial forecasting and scenario planning&lt;/a&gt; and as a company, will no longer be actively maintaining this repository. What this means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This final release is a working, “as-is” version of the software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a company, we will be turning 100% of our focus to the pivot, and therefore, will not be actively maintaining / accepting contributions to this repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thanks to our contributors and beta testers!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I talk too much about the engineering and product side of things, we want to extend our gratitude to our awesome contributors! We had hundreds of individuals contribute to the project and even more helping report bugs, suggest features, and raise new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a huge project and we couldn’t have gotten this far without our early supporters and OSS contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Demo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Recap, Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many of you, this final release comes with a sense of disappointment, and that’s understandable. We’re not excited about this either, and wish we had unlimited time and money to fulfill our vision for this app (we have years worth of new feature designs in the backlog)! In the end, our obligation as a company is to our investors, and as outlined in &lt;a href="https://x.com/Shpigford/status/1947725345244709240"&gt;Josh’s post here&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve determined that continuing to build this app is not our best chance at paying back our investors and profiting as a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, over the last few years, our team has dedicated some serious amount of thought asking the question, “How can we build a better personal finance app?”. And in that light, I’d be remiss not to share some of our biggest successes, failures, and unexpected challenges along the way. We hope that some of these reflections propel the OSS community forward and one day lead to a truly great, OSS personal finance app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The wins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been thinking about personal finance for a lot of years. This isn’t our first attempt at creating this app, and along the way, we’ve learned some valuable lessons that have made it into the final release of this software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A simple, beautiful personal finance app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ed08763-a9ee-42b2-a436-e05038fcf573" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give credit where it is due. Our lead designer @justinfar has done an incredible job crafting a &lt;em&gt;simple and clean&lt;/em&gt; UI. Some of you may look at our app and think, “That’s it?”. But believe us when we say, this was intentional. We spent a lot of time asking the question, “What can we delete?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal with this app was to &lt;em&gt;remove complexity&lt;/em&gt; from personal finance. Many personal finance apps overwhelm the user with dashboards, complex UIs, and too much detail. We believe that many people &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to track their finances but are simply too overwhelmed by the challenge of getting started. Most people need to know just a few important things about their finances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much money do I have?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I spending less than I’m earning?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much did I spend last month?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What am I spending my money on?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This app answers all of those questions and gives the user a simple interface to categorize, organize, and get to those answers quicker. While some users might look for a richer feature set, we believe most users are satisfied with less; not more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A place for everything&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our greatest frustrations with other personal finance apps is not having a “place” or a “home” for common financial scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common scenario in personal finance is a “transfer”. A transfer is a movement of funds from one account to another, and creates a transaction of opposite values on each of those accounts. Many personal finance apps treat these the same as the rest of your transactions and force you into this uncomfortable pattern of using a “Transfer” category or “Excluded” category to filter this noise out of your budgets and metrics. Furthermore, some transfers (like loan payments) should be included in your budgeting while others (like credit card payments) are a “double-count” that should be &lt;em&gt;excluded&lt;/em&gt; from budgets. It forces users to create a “Junk drawer” for the things they don’t know what to do with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maybe app treats transfers as first-class citizens. We auto-detect your transfers and &lt;em&gt;don’t even allow&lt;/em&gt; you to categorize them because they &lt;em&gt;shouldn’t be categorized&lt;/em&gt;. This way, transfers are automatically excluded from budget totals and other metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0b93e1f-7315-4cf3-812e-979aa404dda8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another common scenario is “one time expenses”. Similar to transfers, these expenses (e.g. “moving expenses”) don’t really belong in budgets either. The Maybe app allows you to mark these as “one time” and automatically excludes from your “average spending” and other budget totals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cf5b8e3-480c-4bb9-81b8-0e646dc25c16&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside these common scenarios, the Maybe app also allows you to create various account types and even “reconcile” them to a new balance without creating that nasty “adjustment” transaction that nobody knows how to categorize or what to do with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5592130c-b57a-4344-975f-df8db8992f55&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set out to create an app that has a place for all your financial scenarios, and while I think there is still work to be done on this front, we handled the most important ones (unlike many other apps). And we’re proud of that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A simple stack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No self-hosted app is “easy” to deploy. But we did our best to make things simple. The Maybe app can be &lt;a href="https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/blob/main/docs/hosting/docker.md"&gt;hosted all inside a single Docker container&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;optional&lt;/em&gt; market data API dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the demos of this write-up, I started a brand new self hosted app in less than 10 minutes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The losses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’re stopping active development on this project, there were clearly some losses. Aside from the fact that growing a B2C SaaS app is challenging in its own right from a business perspective, I’ll focus on some of the product/engineering losses that we feel could have been remediated with some more time and money to throw at this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data providers, data providers, data providers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single biggest challenge with a personal finance app in 2025 is bank providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies have had enough time to &lt;em&gt;work around&lt;/em&gt; this challenge with all sorts of clever UIs and mathematical shortcuts, but when push comes to shove, the state of “Open Banking” and bank provider data comes with endless frustration. While we believe we could have slowly but surely solved a &lt;em&gt;majority&lt;/em&gt; of these problems, we simply needed &lt;em&gt;more time and more money to do so&lt;/em&gt;. Below are just a &lt;em&gt;few&lt;/em&gt; of the challenges we were still working through:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsupported banks (there are a TON, and most users churn if even &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of their banks is unsupported)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banks that only support logins at certain times of day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bank provider documentation not matching the production data we received&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bank provider data being plain &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; (there is a surprisingly large amount of this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Idiosyncracies of each financial institution (everyone reports their data a little differently)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vast number of financial securities (i.e. stocks, options, etfs, etc.), many of which have differing data across market providers, and many of which have &lt;em&gt;sparse to zero&lt;/em&gt; data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this is a &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; challenge for anyone building a personal finance app and is the primary reason why “bootstrapping” a personal finance app with automated bank syncing is an uphill battle. You need a lot of money and time to get this right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data consistency and cache invalidation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a dashboard with a net worth graph doesn’t look all that complicated, it’s one of those “iceberg” problems. The more you dig, the more complexity you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A personal finance app needs to show a user’s total net worth trend over time. A personal finance app needs to show average spending. A personal finance needs to show correct balance sheet values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every view of the app touches nearly &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the user’s data. If &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; piece of data is &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;, every view in the app is wrong. There is nowhere to hide in a personal finance app, and even the slightest change to the &lt;em&gt;date&lt;/em&gt; of a historical transaction propagates upstream and affects the net worth graph, account sidebar trends, metrics, budgets, and pretty much every other view of the app!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UI required by users demands a high degree of focus on both performance + accuracy. But in a finance app (or… any app!), these two things are at odds with each other. Achieving full accuracy can be done by writing “facts” to the database (event-sourcing) and &lt;em&gt;deriving&lt;/em&gt; results through queries and materialized views. Keep the data in its “raw” form and delegate the complexity to the &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; side of things. Using this approach, you’re &lt;em&gt;guaranteed&lt;/em&gt; updated data everywhere in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, taking this approach with no answer for the performance side of things will result in an app that is 100% accurate and takes 3 minutes to load each page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having learned some lessons from our V1 approach to building this app, we opted for a “hybrid event-sourced” approach. We wrote “facts” (i.e. transactions, trades, valuations) to the database, “synced” them in background jobs, and wrote them to “cache tables” (i.e. &lt;code&gt;balances&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;holdings&lt;/code&gt;). This made the &lt;em&gt;query side&lt;/em&gt; of things a lot simpler (still not simple though) and improved performance, but at the &lt;em&gt;cost&lt;/em&gt; of data consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I believe the final version of this app comes &lt;em&gt;close&lt;/em&gt; to full accuracy / consistency of data, there are still inevitable challenges here and something we wish we could have spent some more time on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The unexpected challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, let’s talk about a few of the challenges we didn’t know we’d be facing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;OSS, financial privacy, and project management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an open source project, we constantly received bug reports. Unfortunately (but understandably), many users are not comfortable sharing their personal financial situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This created an odd dynamic. We are open source, but in order to fix data bugs, we need to look at the data. If the user can’t share all the required information, we can’t reproduce the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure there’s a great solution to this. It made the project management and bug fixing side of things extremely challenging. We wanted to manage all issues on the public repo, but by the nature of the app, we ended up having to track some issues internally and privately and others publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It made things hard to see it all in one spot, and we didn’t realize how much of a roadblock this would become for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Multi-currency + Investments Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a multi-currency app is tough to begin with. We took on this challenge in the spirit of OSS and I believe we built a fairly comprehensive and solid solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, having global users exposed us to the global markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To say this is challenging is an understatement and then some. Let’s start with some basic numbers (don’t fact check me, this is largely coming from a quick ChatGPT session, but should be in the ballpark):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are ~180 currencies globally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are ~46k global exchanges, all of which have different securities and different prices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are ~55k publicly traded companies globally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are 120k+ mutual funds, ~10k ETFs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crypto… (we won’t go there)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to show an &lt;em&gt;accurate&lt;/em&gt; investment portfolio graph, we need historical prices for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the user’s securities in their portfolio. Given the fact that there is no single data provider that supplies all these prices, many providers treat exchange codes differently, and market data is &lt;em&gt;extremely expensive&lt;/em&gt;, this become one of our foremost challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up allowing users to create “manual” tickers which has worked fairly well. But the scope of this problem is huge and there’s a reason entire applications are built to solely handle investment data (often US-based only).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given our tiny team and short time horizon, we’re proud of what we’ve built here and the contributions we’ve made to OSS in the process. We’ve built the “engine” and we hope the OSS community can take this core engine and build some interesting use-cases on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, farewell! Maybe…&lt;/p&gt;</content>
