    <content>&lt;h2&gt;Budgeting is here!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long awaited feature, Maybe now supports budgeting!  We believe budgeting should be easy and simple.  Categorize your transactions, mark transfers, one-time expenses, and get a clear breakdown of where your money is going each month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content>&lt;h2&gt;Data resets, offline investment trades, and miscellaneous stability improvements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release comes with a wide mix of stability improvements and quality of life updates; particularly for self hosted apps, which can now be "reset" in user settings.  If your data looks wrong or you want a "clean slate" to work from, we've added the ability for you to easily perform these resets without writing SQL or manually deleting records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release also comes with a much clearer UI surrounding the Synth data provider.  New self hosted users will now see a prominent warning message if they have missing data as a result of a misconfigured or absent data provider.&lt;/p&gt;
