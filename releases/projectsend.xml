    <content>&lt;p&gt;New feature: throttle and ban failed log in attempts to prevent brute force attacks.
New in security Settings: whitelist or blacklist IPs from the log in ban feature.
New in Tools: unblock a banned IP address
New feature: cron jobs. Set up a task that can send pending email notifications in batches, deletes expired files and orphan files.
New Cron settings page: Enable/disable cron, change cron security key, select which tasks to run, enable or disable running via url, save log to database, send results via email.
New in Tools: Cron log viewer
Orphan files can now be filtered by allowed/not allowed.
If Recaptcha is enabled, use it on login, password reset request and register forms
New setting: disable sending email notifications of new files after adding/editing assignations. Enable this and combine it with a cron task to prevent long loading times after saving a file and overloading your mail server.
Updates are now separated into different files, with the latest database update number being independent from the software version. Cleans up the process and makes adding new updates easier.

Fixed .htaccess (by RoboDoc)
Batch actions are sent as post instead of get to prevent malicious users from sending an action url to an admin user
